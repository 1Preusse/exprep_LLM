This repository contains files for a project on Finte Tuning LLM's for text classification.<br>
The folders GoEmotion and DBPedia 14 contian jupyter notebooks used to train the models distillbert and minilm on the dataset:<br>

https://huggingface.co/datasets/fancyzhx/dbpedia_14 <br>

The models are trained by classical fine tuning on the original layers as well as using LoRa between the Input and Output Layers.<br>
A Description of these techniques can be found in the research folders jupyter notebook called information.
